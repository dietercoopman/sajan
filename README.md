**ðŸš§ THIS TOOL IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§** 

Sajan is a lightweight command line tool written in php for webdevelopers.

The tool provides them with shortcuts for multiline commands or opens a world of hidden oneliners.

## Requirements

Sajan is a shell tool tested on MacOs desktop and Linux servers

Sajan uses tools like brew, git, npm, node and composer.

For us brew is the best tool to install these programs, so we depend on it. If you don't have it, you can install it easily via sajan.

## Installation

The purpose of sajan is simplicity, and that starts with the installation ...

````shell
composer require dietercoopman/sajan
````
